:cvIntro: |+
  Product designer with 6 years of experience. Mostly obsessed with UX, rapid prototyping, design systems and branding.

  When able I implement my designs in code. I have experience working with vast e-Commerce projects as well as aesthetic campaign websites from both design and development perspectives. I also dabble in animated videos, 3D imagery and audio production.
