  :textBlock: "# Canon's problem statement\n\n# Canon wanted us to help them improve
    the UI & UX of their Canon Store Website. \n\n# As it stands, design is wedged
    into the process as an afterthought. Rather than having the design lead the digital
    product. \n\nThere is a discrepancy between the sources of truth that designers
    rely on. But also there is a gap in communication between designers and developers.
    This renders the current website with inconsistencies in both the front-end and
    design. Which directly hinders Canon's goal of becoming a <mark>premium</mark>
    Canon Store. \n\n\n"

  :textBlock: "# The solution\n\nA potential solution would be to redesign the whole
    website. Stamping each design with a premium mark and calling it a day.  \n\nBut
    the real solution was to create a design system. A system which embodies: design
    principles, accessibility, design language and business rules. That would help
    Canon be more consistent throughout their current digital products. But also future
    Canon products. \n\nThis project has two major deliverables; the actual design
    system, but also the design process that comes with it.\n"

  :textBlock: "# Why design systems?\n\n> Design systems are not new. Design systems
    have existed in parallel with branding guidelines for a long time. But only recently
    have design systems taken a more digital approach.\n\nWhen we looked back at our
    current design process of Canon. We realised that most designs decisions were
    sourced from multiple style-guides or systems. \n\nWe joked that we'd create another
    style-guide and confuse everyone even more. So it was important to get this design
    system right. "

  :textBlock: "# How to get it right?\n\nBy making sure it's future proofed. Looking
    back at the old styleguides. We found that most of them lived inside static documents.
    More sophisticated styleguides lived online, but no one maintained them. So they
    were essentially no better than static PDFs. \n\nSo to get it right we needed
    to two-way bind the design system and the final production site. To avoid maintaining
    two separate entities.  "

  :textBlock: "# What did we do?  \n\nWe helped educate the client that exploring
    homepage designs wasn't going to work. \n\nBy showing them examples of successful
    digital products and their corresponding design systems. They were able to see
    the importance of design systems. \n\nWe did our research on other design systems
    before we dove in. We found that more successful design systems weren't just a
    library of components. They were a collection jigsaw puzzle pieces, or Atoms.
    \nAtoms resonated with me because the word tells what we wanted to achieve; a
    building block. We wanted fundamental building blocks to build up the whole system.\n\nWe
    discovered the popular Atom-approach to CSS (Tachyons, or acss.io). Where small
    CSS utility classes would drive the layout and look of everything. \n\nBy using
    these CSS utilities that we'd call Atoms. We were able to build everything we
    wanted within a design constraint. \n\nConsider the following CSS Atom:\n\n    .f3
    { font-size: 3 rem; }\n\nThis Atom handles two things; the font-size, and how
    big the font-size is. \n\nImagine this next Atom:\n\n    .f4 { font-size: 4 rem;
    }\n\nIt handles the same thing, but it increases that font-size by 1 rem. \nWe
    have now successfully created a simple typescale that is constrained to a set
    of design rules.\n\n![typescale](//images.contentful.com/y77stanzu634/4tyvCyh7egiAYQGYKCE24G/1231e1720911abe991df5009b3b08043/Screen_Shot_2017-09-25_at_18.08.58.png)\n\nWe
    can now put in any font-size inside the CSS declaration. \nA fundamental example,
    but it showcases our thinking.\nUsing this formula, we built the whole design
    system for Canon."

  :textBlock: "# What did we solve? \n\nThe problem statement mentioned that design
    was treated like an afterthought, this has been solved with the new design system
    that works like a two-way binding between the final product and the design rules.\n\nThe
    design systems helps designers to fast-track prototyping. Giving them the ability
    to produce working prototypes that can be used for user testing. Which will also
    make the resulting data more accurate. \n\nIt gives designers a front-end framework
    that they can use to build pages that are always up to date. \n\nBusiness Analysts
    to refer to the design system when working out new requirements with the business.
    \n\nIt helps developers be more consistent and efficient when building out new
    features. Because they no longer have to make up new components from scratch by
    eyeing a static design documents.  \n\nCSS is deceptively hard to write on a large
    scale. By having one CSS file that dictates the content for everything. And not
    having to write new CSS for every new feature, means that were limiting the mistakes
    that can be made. (And reduced CSS file bandwidth)\n\nRefactoring is easier because
    everything is build by Atoms. \nFor instance when removing CSS code, its easier
    to anticipate what it changes. \n"

  :textBlock: "# What did we not solve? \n\nWe wanted the design system to be built
    upon React. To be able to componentize each design pattern such as button, inputs.
    Our Atoms would live inside each React component. A button for a designer shouldn't
    be a bunch of CSS utility classes in a row â€” it should be something like\n\n    <PrimaryButton>Link</PrimaryButton>\n
    \   \nAs opposed to:\n\n    <button class=\"ph2 pv1 bg-red white dib mr2 mb2\">Link</button>\n\nWe
    didn't solve this because of resourcing and time constraints. But we're are looking
    forward to bring React in the next step.\n\nWe stress-tested the Atom design approach
    with a conceptual homepage. But ideally we would have time to stress test the
    approach with real data and try to re-create the pages that currently exists on
    the Canon Store. \n\n![typoexamples](//images.contentful.com/y77stanzu634/6qaeh9XgBOSgEk8SUSya8G/30b2de702bd5c476677b5dec63d6192a/typoshowcase.jpg)\n\nAbove
    is a screenshot of a HTML prototype. It's showcasing the typographical scale and
    how powerful the layout Atoms can be. \n\nWe user tested the initial home page
    explorations. We wanted to gauge how well a user can complete a task, along with
    the visual attractiveness of the site. (<mark>Premium</mark> experience). We didn't
    have time to user test the design system. By that I mean re-creating the Canon
    site as a prototype with the new design system and use the old Canon Store website
    as a control. \n\nAtomic CSS approach needs a pragmatic approach for it to work
    well. \n\nFor instance; building a custom complex navigation with Atomic CSS will
    be hard. The Atomic approach has troubles staying reusable. This is because everything
    is exploded into smaller utility classes. \n\nA primary-button class reused throughout
    the whole site is trivial to change. \n\nBut that logic can be dangerous because
    you are changing things site-wide and unseen changes are often overlooked. \n\nwith
    React this problem no longer exists because of the decoupled styling it offers. "

  :textBlock: "# Implementing\n\nCreating the design system easy. Actually implementing
    the system is 90% of the work. \n\nSo how does one go about implementing a design
    system? Like most things in product design, it's about talking to people. Simply
    sharing the befits of a design system should make heads turn:\n\n- Higher return
    of investment due to faster loading times\n- Less time & money is spent on development
    and design\n- More accurate user testing, thus enabling the business to make better
    design decisions\n- A more consistent and premium experience for users"

  :textBlock: "# What now?\n\nThe current system is again lacking major features such
    as states. But we didn't implement them because we'd need a proper React setup.
    Which wasn't added due to budget constraints.\n\nLike I mentioned, this deliverable
    is bundled with a design process. For a company to adopt a design system and making
    it work requires some effort. In an ideal world, every designer would be comfortable
    creating mockups in HTML rather than using design software that produces static
    images. In an ideal world, the developers receive a HTML deliverable that needs
    very little tweaking. Business requirements would be based of the design system,
    rather than making a *special case* for every new feature. \n\n"
