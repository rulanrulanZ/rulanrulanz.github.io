  :textBlock: Indulging into the world of poetry can be quite daunting especially
    for an audience with increasingly short web-attention. At This Place we came up
    with a fresh way to introduce poetry for a new audience - through Memes. In other
    words, a hand-picked poem verse pasted onto an image. With the idea of it being
    shared online

  :textBlock: The home page is adorned with a content slider, featuring a random poetry
    verse matched with Memes that correspond with the verse displayed. It's a smart
    way to show what the website is about at a glance. Reading poetry or explore memes.

  :textBlock: "A great challenge for us was to develop a Meme creator that works on
    any screen. The solution was eventually brought forward through extensive prototyping
    and testing every edge-case. Our device-agnostic approach also forced us to pick
    technologies that would work on any device slimming down our tech options significantly.
    \n\nIn the end we ended up using canvas and webGL stacks to help generating the
    Memes. \n"

    from a size of 16x16 pixels and sometimes smaller. That meant that each icon had
    to be thoughtfully crafted on a 16x16 pixel grid to avoid rendering issues on
    lower-resolution screens
