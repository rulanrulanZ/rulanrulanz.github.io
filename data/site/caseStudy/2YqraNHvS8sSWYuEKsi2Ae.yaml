  :textBlock: "I designed Norse Sans. A typeface that is\n\n# Legible at small sizes.\nBecause
    it's a digital typeface it needed to work it's magic on all sizes.\n\n# Design
    system ready\nThe typeface should be versatile enough that it can be used as the
    sole workhorse within a brand. \n\n# Idiosyncratic but easy to read\nThe biggest
    catch-22 within type design is the will to be different from other typefaces.
    But quickly realising that legibility is more important. Sure that uppercase R
    might look swanky, but if the reader need to stop everytime they see a certain
    letter, it's bad design. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
