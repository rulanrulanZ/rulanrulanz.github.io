  :textBlock: "It’s been roughly 3 years since I launched my previous portfolio. While
    my old site received a great deal of positive feedback and won various features
    and awards, I still wanted a new portfolio to reflect the current me.\n\n# Tech
    bits\n\nI knew from the inception of the project that this website had to be written
    from scratch so that I could have 100% control over it.\n\nFor this portfolio
    I used Middleman which is a static site generator written in Ruby which spits
    out static pages that are ready to be deployed. Because the pages are static the
    website becomes very lightweight and reliable. \n\nMiddleman out-of-the-box allows
    for SCSS and HAML and other sexy technologies to be used. But I decided to keep
    it lean to reduce as many dependencies as possible.\n\nI deploy my portfolio via
    Netlify, which allows me to reap their CDN locations which gives blazing fast
    load times.\n\nIgnoring CSS frameworks kept the stylesheets lean, not to mention
    I would find it hard to apply them to this quite straightforward layout.\n\n#
    Design bits\n\nI wanted to the design to be very sharp and ungimmicky. Displaying
    only the elements you really need to see. I targeted design-interested people
    with desktops \n> Analytics shows that 92% of my audience is browsing the website
    from a Desktop device \n\n— Therefore I put extra care catering the desktop experience
    of the site, making sure it looked as good as possible on the big screen. \n\n\n\nThe
    staple of the website is what I call the Tile:\n\n<ul class=\"tiles mt-s mb-s\">\n<li
    class=\"reveal tile\" style=\"width:50%\" data-lspacer=\"0\">\n  <a class=\"tile-link\"
    href=\"/casestudy/husqvarna\">\n    <div class=\"tile-content\" style=\"color:
    #fff\">\n      <div class=\"tile-title\">I'm a nice looking <span>Tile</span></div>\n\n
    \     <span class=\"f5\">\n        2014\n        <span class=\"readmore\" href=\"husqvarna\">\n
    \       \t-&gt;\n        </span>\n      </span>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"tile-bg\">\n
    \         <div class=\"tile-image\">\n            <div style=\"padding-bottom:100%\"
    class=\"reveal image reveal_visible\">\n  <img src=\"/images/avo.png\" alt=\"avo\">\n</div>\n\n
    \         </div>\n      <div class=\"tile-cover\" style=\"background: #3238b2\">\n
    \     </div>\n      <div class=\"tile-shadow\" style=\"background-color: rgba(110,49,30,
    .25); box-shadow:rgba(110,49,30, .25) 0px 2px 2px, rgba(110,49,30, .25) 0px 4px
    4px, rgba(110,49,30, .25) 0px 8px 8px, rgba(110,49,30, .25) 0px 16px 16px, rgba(110,49,30,
    .25) 0px 32px 32px, rgba(110,49,30, .25) 0px 64px 64px;\">\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n
    \ </a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nOther than being a sweet tile it can hold an image on
    mouseover as well as displaying additional text.\n\nThe tile spatially aware so
    it will never expand towards the edge of the screen. Try downsizing the window
    on the homepage to see the effect.\n\nThe tiles change to a stacked design on
    mobile viewports.\n\n# Typography bits\n\nThe font I'm using is called GT-Cinetype.
    It's absolutely gorge. Do zoom in to see the jagged edges of the font.\n\n<span
    style=\"font-size:24rem; line-height:20rem;\">R<span>\n\nI increased the body
    font size considerably since my last portfolio. This was to force myself to write
    shorter sentences. I personally believe it's better to write concise & powerful
    sentences rather than over-explaining things.\n\n# End bits\n\nHopeful this new
    portfolio will serve me for longer than 6 weeks before I grow bored of it again.
    As of writing this article I am happy how it turned out — if you are curious about
