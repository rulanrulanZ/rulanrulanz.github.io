  :textBlock: "[Link to prototype](https://colorgen.netlify.com)\n\nWhen working with
    brand colours I always found it a bit messy to simply guess the colors in a color
    palette. Colours shouldn't be made up out of the blue (heh). They should be thoughtfully
    chosen based on a set of principles. Think hue rotation, darkness, lightness,
    brightness, saturation and many more color parameters. \n\n![colorgen image](//images.contentful.com/y77stanzu634/5hGhpuuqNySqeqQ68kywE6/0540f19aba406e55c22da9723fa78583/Screen_Shot_2017-08-25_at_14.38.12.png)\n\nWhen
    building design systems it's important that every UI element has a purpose and
    is build with a certain logic in mind, and it should be the same for colours.
    \n\nWith this problem in mind I developed a palette generator. \n\nEnter any color
    HEX or color name and it will generate an aesthetically pleasing palette that
    will complement the key color. The colours that are generated are hue rotated,
    darkened or lightened accordingly to be a perfect match with the key color that
    was entered.\n\nUse the generated colors for hover effects, branding elements,
    marketing and those obscure edge-cases where you need that lighter version of
    the brand color. \n\nAt this time there is only one set of color principles in
    place. But in the future I will add custom color parameters, where designers can
    fine tune how the color palette is generated. Until then I need to learn more
    about VueJS.\n\n"
